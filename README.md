# Mitro_Bank_Project


# 🏦 Credit Card Strategy Project — Mitron Bank

This is a **data analysis project** for **Mitron Bank**, a legacy financial institution based in Hyderabad, aiming to launch a **new line of credit cards**. The analysis is based on a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five Indian cities.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Mitron Bank wants to broaden its product offerings in the credit card segment. Before awarding the full-scale project, they asked for a pilot study to understand market segments, spending patterns, and customer behavior.

**Peter Pandey**, a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services (you!), was assigned to lead this pilot. The results will help Mitron Bank tailor credit card offerings and evaluate the potential of a long-term partnership.
